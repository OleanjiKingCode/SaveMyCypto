SaveYOURCrypto is an open-source project that empowers traders, developers, and anyone earning from the crypto space to securely lock up their assets for a predetermined period. When the lockup period expires or the assets are unlocked, the system sends a notification to the owner. If the owner doesn't respond within the first 5 days, the system automatically notifies the designated next of kin, providing instructions on how to withdraw the assets.

## Features

- **Asset Lockup**: Securely lock your cryptocurrency assets for a defined period.
- **Notification**: Receive notifications when the lockup period ends or the assets are unlocked.
- **Next of Kin**: If you don't respond within 5 days, your designated next of kin is notified.
- **Withdrawal Instructions**: Clear and simple instructions for asset withdrawal.
